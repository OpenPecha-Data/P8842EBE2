The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to the Realized One that he has taught
the dharma? Subhūti, anybody who would say such things as ‘The Tathāgata has taught the
dharma’ would misrepresent me, Subhūti, on account of wrong learning.Why is that? As for
the so-called ‘teaching of the dharma,’ Subhūti, there exists no dharma whatsoever which
can be apprehended called the teaching of the dharma.”
