The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to a Non-returner that he has obtained
the fruit of a Non-returner?”[Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord. It does not occur to a
Non-returner that he has obtained the fruit of a Non-returner.] Why is that? There is no dharma
whatsoever which observes that it is a Non-returner. That is why one is called ‘a Non-returner.’”
