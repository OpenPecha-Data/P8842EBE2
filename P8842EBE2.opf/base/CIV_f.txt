“However, Subhūti, this is the way in which a bodhisattva should engage in the giving away of
gifts for the benefit of all living beings, but any idea of a living being is indeed idealess.All
living beings of whom the Realized One has preached are indeed beingless.The Realized
One, Subhūti, speaks truly, the Realized One tells the truth, he tells things as they
are, the Realized One does not tell lies.
