“If, however, someone were to amass piles of the seven treasures as high as all the Sumerus,
kings of all mountains, in the trigalactic megagalactic world-system and give them as a gift,
Subhūti, and if someone else were to do no more than learn just a four-lined verse from
this Perfection of Insight and teach it to others, then the former quantity of merit, Subhūti,
does not approach even a hundredth part of the latter quantity of merit and so on,
until nor does it even permit of any analogy.
