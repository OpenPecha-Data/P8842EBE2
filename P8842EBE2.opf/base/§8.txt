“What do you think, Subhūti?If someone were to fill this trigalactic megagalactic world-system
with the seven treasures and give it as a gift, then what do you think, Subhūti, would
that gentleman or lady generate a lot of merit on that basis?”Subhūti said, “A lot, Lord,
a lot, Blessed One. That gentleman or lady would generate a lot of merit on that basis.Why
is that? It is indeed, Lord, quantityless. For that reason the Realized One preaches that
a quantity of merit is quantityless.”The Lord said, “If, however, some gentleman or lady
were to fill this trigalactic megagalactic world-system with the seven treasures and give
it as a gift, Subhūti,and if someone else were to do no more than learn just one four-lined
verse from this round of teachings and teach and illuminate it for others, then the latter
would on that basis generate a lot more merit, an immeasurable, incalculable amount.Why
is that? Because it is from this, Subhūti, that the supreme and perfect awakening of the
Realized Ones is born,it is from this that the Buddhas and Lords are born.What is the reason
for that?The so-called ‘dharmas of a Buddha,’ Subhūti, are indeed devoid of any dharmas
of a Buddha.
