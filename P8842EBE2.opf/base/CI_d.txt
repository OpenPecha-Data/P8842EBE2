The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to a Worthy One that he has obtained
the state of a Worthy One?”Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord. Why is that? Because there is
no dharma whatsoever, Lord, which is called a Worthy One. If, Lord, it should occur to a
Worthy One that he has obtained the state of a Worthy One, then for him that would indeed
constitute seizing upon a self, it would constitute seizing upon a living being, seizing
upon a soul, seizing upon a person.
