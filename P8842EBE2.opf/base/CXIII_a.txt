“If, however, some gentleman or lady were to take as many world-systems as there are dust-particles
of earth in the trigalactic megagalactic world-system, Subhūti, and grind them to
powder, so that they were like, say, a pile of the most minute atoms, what do you think, Subhūti?
Would that pile of the most minute atoms be considerable?”He said, “Quite so, Lord,
that pile of the most minute atoms would be considerable.Why is that? If, Lord, there were
a pile, the Lord would not say ‘pile of the most minute atoms.’Why is that? Any pile of
the most minute atoms which has been preached has been preached as pile-less by the Lord.
That is why it is called ‘a pile of the most minute atoms.’
