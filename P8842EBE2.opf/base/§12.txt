“However, Subhūti, the piece of ground where one might do no more than recite or teach just
a four-lined verse from this round of teachings would become a veritable shrine for the whole
world with its gods, humans and anti-gods, so it goes without saying, Subhūti, that those
who will memorize this round of teachings will come to be endowed with the most marvellous
thing, and on that piece of ground the Teacher himself dwells, or one or another of his
venerable lieutenants.”
