“However, Subhūti, any perfection of acceptance the Realized One has is indeed perfectionless.Why
is that? When, Subhūti, King Kaliṃga cut off my limbs and extremities, I did not have
at that time any idea of a self or idea of a living being or idea of a soul or idea of a
person. I had no idea whatsoever, nor any non-idea.Why is that? If, Subhūti, I had had the
idea of a self at that time, I would also have had the idea of ill-will at that time. [(Cz
77,24-26:) If I had had a perception of a being, a perception of a soul, a perception of
a person, then I would also have had a perception of ill-will at that time.]I remember,
Subhūti, 500 rebirths in the past when I was the sage Kṣāntivādin, and then too I had no idea
of a self, no idea of a living being, no idea of a soul, and no idea of a person.“For
that reason, then, Subhūti, a bodhisattva and mahāsattva should conceive the aspiration for
supreme and perfect awakening after eliminating all ideas, he should not conceive an aspiration
which is fixed on forms, he should not conceive an aspiration which is fixed on sounds,
smells, tastes, or objects of touch, he should not conceive an aspiration which is fixed
on dharmas, he should not conceive an aspiration which is fixed on non-dharmas, he should
not conceive an aspiration which is fixed on anything.What is the reason for that? Whatever
is fixed is indeed unfixed. For that very reason the Realized One preaches that a gift
should be given by one without fixing on form.
