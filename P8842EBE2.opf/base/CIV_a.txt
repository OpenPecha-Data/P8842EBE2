Then the Venerable Subhūti burst into tears at the impact of the dharma. Wiping his tears away
as he continued to shed them, he said this to the Lord,“It is a marvellous thing, Lord,
it is a most marvellous thing, Blessed One, that this round of teachings has been preached
by the Realized One. Since knowledge arose for me, Lord, I have never heard a round of teachings
of this kind before.They will come to be endowed with a most marvellous thing, Lord,
who when this discourse is being preached conceive the idea that it is the truth. But
any such idea of truth, Lord, is indeed idealess. Therefore the Realized One preaches the
so-called ‘idea of truth.’
