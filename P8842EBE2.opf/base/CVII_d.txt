“Should anyone say, Subhūti, that the Realized One has fully awakened to supreme and perfect
awakening, [he would be speaking a falsehood,]1 there is no dharma whatsoever to which the
Realized One has fully awakened as supreme and perfect awakening.In the dharma to which
the Realized One has fully awakened, there is no truth and no falsehood. Therefore the Realized
One preaches ‘All dharmas are Buddha-dharmas.’As far as ‘all dharmas’ are concerned,
Subhūti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called ‘all dharmas.’
