“What do you think, Subhūti? Can a Realized One be seen by virtue of the possession of distinctive
features?”He said, “Quite so, Lord, a Realized One can be seen by virtue of the possession
of distinctive features.”(H 156,n12: The positive reply made negative is a later amendation.)The
Lord said, “If, however, a Realized One could be seen by virtue of the possession
of distinctive features, Subhūti, a wheel-turning king would also be a Realized One.”He
said, “As I understand the meaning of what the Lord has preached, a Realized One cannot
be seen by virtue of the possession of distinctive features.”Then on that occasion the
Lord uttered these verses:

“Whoever saw me through my physical form,Whoever followed me through the sound of my voice,Engaged
in the wrong endeavours,Those people will not see me.
