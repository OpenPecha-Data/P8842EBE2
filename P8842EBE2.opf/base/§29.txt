“However, Subhūti, if someone were to say that the Realized One goes or comes or stands or sits
or lies down, he does not understand the meaning of what I have preached.Why is that?
He who is called ‘the Realized One’ (tathāgata), Subhūti, has not come (āgata) from anywhere,
nor has he gone (gata) anywhere. That is why he is called ‘the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly
Awakened One.’
