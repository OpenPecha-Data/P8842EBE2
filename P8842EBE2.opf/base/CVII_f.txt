The Lord said, “Quite so, Subhūti. Any bodhisattva who would say such things as ‘I will bring
living beings to final extinction’ should not be called a bodhisattva.Why is that? Does
any dharma at all exist called ‘a bodhisattva,’ Subhūti?”He said, “No indeed, Lord.”The Lord
said, “Therefore the Realized One preaches that all dharmas are devoid of a living being,
devoid of a soul, devoid of a person.
