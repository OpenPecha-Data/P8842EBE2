The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Can a Realized, Worthy, and Perfectly Awakened One
be seen by virtue of the 32 Distinctive Features of a Great Man?”Subhūti said, “No indeed,
Lord. Why is that? Whatever 32 Distinctive Features of a Great Man have been preached
by the Realized One, Lord, have been preached by the Realized One as featureless. Therefore
they are called ‘the 32 Distinctive Features of a Great Man.’”
