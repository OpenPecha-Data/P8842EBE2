The bodhisattva, Subhūti, who would say such things as ‘I shall make the dispositions of a field
perfect’ should also be described in just that way.Why is that? The Realized One has
preached, Subhūti, that the so-called ‘dispositions of a field’ are dispositionless. That
is why they are called ‘dispositions of a field.’
