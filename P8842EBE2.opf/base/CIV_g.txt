“However, Subhūti, in that dharma which the Realized One has awakened to and taught there is
no truth and no falsehood.Subhūti, one should regard a bodhisattva who has sunk to the level
of objects and who gives away a gift which has sunk to the level of objects as being like,
say, a man who has been plunged into darkness.Subhūti, one should regard a bodhisattva
who gives a gift which has not sunk to the level of objects as being like, say, a man endowed
with sight, who would see shapes of various kinds when dawn breaks and the sun comes
up.
