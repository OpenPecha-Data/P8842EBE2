“What do you think, Subhūti? Is there any dharma which the Realized One had from the Realized
One Dīpaṃkara by which he fully awakened to supreme and perfect awakening?”He said, “There
is no dharma whatsoever which the Realized One had from the Realized One Dīpaṃkara by which
he fully awakened to supreme and perfect awakening.”[(Cz 82,20-31:) The Lord: So it is,
Subhuti, so it is, there is no dharma by which the Tathagata, when he was in the presence
of Dipankara, the Tathagata, Arhat, Fully Enlightened One, has awoken to the utmost, right
and perfect enlightenment. If again, Subhuti, some dharma had been fully known by the
Tathagata, not of me would the Tathagata Dipankara have predicted: «You, young Brahmin, will
in a future period be a Tathagata, Arhat, Fully Enlightened, by the name Śākyamuni». Because
then, Subhuti, there is not any dharma by which the Tathagata, Arhat, Fully Enlightened
One has fully known the utmost, right and perfect enlightenment,]He said, “Therefore the
Realized One Dīpaṃkara predicted of me ‘At a future time, young man, you will become a
Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened One by the name of Śākyamuni!’
