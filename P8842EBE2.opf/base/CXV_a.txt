“If, however, any bodhisattva and mahāsattva were to fill immeasurable and incalculable world-systems
with the seven treasures and make a gift of them, Subhūti, and if some gentleman
or lady were to do no more than learn just a four-lined verse from this Perfection of Insight
and memorize it, teach it, and master it, [and elucidate it in full for others,]1 the
latter would generate from that a lot more merit, an immeasurable and incalculable amount.And
how should he elucidate it? So as not to throw light on it. That is why one says ‘he
should elucidate it.’

A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp,An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble,A dream,
a lightning’s flash, a thunder cloud—This is the way one should see the conditioned.”
