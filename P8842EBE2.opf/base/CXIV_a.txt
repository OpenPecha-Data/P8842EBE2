“Why is that? If someone were to say, Subhūti, that the Realized One preached the view of a
self, the view of a living being, the view of a soul, the view of a person, would he be saying
the right thing by saying that, Subhūti?”He said, “No, Lord. Why is that? Any view of
a self, Lord, preached of by the Realized One has been preached by the Realized One as viewless.
That is why it is called ‘a view of a self.’”
