A Buddha is visible through the dharma,A Realized One has the dharma for a body,But the nature
of dharma being unknowable by sensory consciousness,It cannot be known by sensory consciousness.”

“What do you think, Subhūti? Did the Realized One awaken fully to supreme and perfect awakening
through the possession of distinctive features?This is again not the way one should see
things, Subhūti. The Realized One did not awaken fully to supreme and perfect awakening
through the possession of distinctive features.“Moreover, Subhūti, if it should be thought
that those who have set out on the bodhisattva path assert the destruction of any dharma
or its annihilation, then once again, Subhūti, this is not the way one should see things.Those
who have set out on the bodhisattva path do not assert the destruction or annihilation
of any dharma whatsoever.

“If, however, some gentleman or lady were to fill as many world-systems as there are grains
of sand in the Ganges River with the seven treasures and give them as a gift to the Realized,
Worthy and Perfectly Awakened Ones, Subhūti, and if some bodhisattva were to attain acceptance
with regard to the fact that dharmas are devoid of self, [and devoid of arising,]1
the latter would generate from that a lot more merit. However, Subhūti, the quantity of
merit should not be acquired by the bodhisattva.”He said, “Lord, should the quantity of merit
be acquired?”The Lord said, “It should be acquired, Subhūti, but should not be taken up.
That is why one says ‘It should be acquired.’

“However, Subhūti, if someone were to say that the Realized One goes or comes or stands or sits
or lies down, he does not understand the meaning of what I have preached.Why is that?
He who is called ‘the Realized One’ (tathāgata), Subhūti, has not come (āgata) from anywhere,
nor has he gone (gata) anywhere. That is why he is called ‘the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly
Awakened One.’
