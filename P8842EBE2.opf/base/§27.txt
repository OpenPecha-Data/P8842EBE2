“What do you think, Subhūti? Did the Realized One awaken fully to supreme and perfect awakening
through the possession of distinctive features?This is again not the way one should see
things, Subhūti. The Realized One did not awaken fully to supreme and perfect awakening
through the possession of distinctive features.“Moreover, Subhūti, if it should be thought
that those who have set out on the bodhisattva path assert the destruction of any dharma
or its annihilation, then once again, Subhūti, this is not the way one should see things.Those
who have set out on the bodhisattva path do not assert the destruction or annihilation
of any dharma whatsoever.
