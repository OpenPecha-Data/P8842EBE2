At these words the Venerable Subhūti said this to the Lord,“Can it be, Lord, that there will
be any living beings at a future time, when the final five hundred years come to pass, who,
when the words of such discourses as these are being spoken, will conceive the idea that
they are the truth?”The Lord said, “Subhūti, you must not say things like ‘Can it be that
there will be any living beings at a future time, when the final five hundred years come
to pass, who, when the words of such discourses as these are being spoken, will conceive
the idea that they are the truth?’!On the contrary, Subhūti, there will be bodhisattvas and
mahāsattvas at a future time, when in the final five hundred years the destruction of the
true dharma is coming to pass, who will be endowed with moral conduct, good qualities, and
insight.Moreover it is not the case, Subhūti, that the bodhisattvas will have served a
single Buddha, or that they will have planted the roots of goodness under a single Buddha.On
the contrary, Subhūti, they will have served many Buddhas, they will have planted the roots
of goodness under many Buddhas.As for those who, when the words of such discourses as
these are being spoken, will experience the serenity of faith, even if it is for no more
than a single thought,the Realized One knows them, Subhūti, the Realized One sees them, Subhūti.
They will all generate and come to be endowed with an immeasurable quantity of merit.Why
is that? Because, Subhūti, the idea of a self will not occur to those bodhisattvas,
nor will the idea of a living being, or the idea of a soul, or the idea of a person occur
to them.Not even the idea of a dharma will occur to those bodhisattvas, Subhūti, nor the idea
of a non-dharma; not even an idea or a non-idea will occur to them.Why is that? If, Subhūti,
the idea of a dharma should occur to those bodhisattvas, for them that would constitute
seizing upon a self, it would constitute seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a
soul, seizing upon a person.If the idea of a non-dharma should occur, for them that would
constitute seizing upon a self, seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a soul, seizing
upon a person.Why is that? One should moreover not take up any dharma, Subhūti, or any non-dharma.It
was therefore with this in mind that the Realized One said that those who understand
the round of teachings of the Simile of the Raft should let go of the dharmas themselves,
to say nothing of the non-dharmas.”
