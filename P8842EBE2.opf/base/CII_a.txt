The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Did the Realized One learn any dharma at all from
the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened One Dīpaṃkara?”Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord.
There is no dharma at all which the Realized One learned from the Realized, Worthy and
Perfectly Awakened One Dīpaṃkara.”
