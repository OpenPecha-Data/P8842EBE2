The Lord said, “Any bodhisattva, Subhūti, who says ‘I will make the dispositions of a field
perfect!’ would be telling a lie.Why is that? Because these so-called ‘dispositions of a field,’
Subhūti, have been preached by the Realized One as dispositionless. That is why they
are called ‘dispositions of a field.’
