He said, “How, Lord, should one who has set out on the bodhisattva path take his stand, how
should he proceed, how should he control the mind?”The Lord said, “In this regard, Subhūti,
one who has set out on the bodhisattva path should have the following thought,‘I should
bring all living beings to final extinction in the realm of extinction without substrate remaining.
But after I have brought living beings to final extinction in this way, no living
being whatsoever has been brought to extinction.’Why is that? If, Subhūti, the idea of a
living being were to occur to a bodhisattva, or the idea of a soul or the idea of a person,
he should not be called a bodhisattva.Why is that? There is no dharma called ‘one who has
set out on the bodhisattva path.’
