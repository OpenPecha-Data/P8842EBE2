The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are
grains of sand in the Ganges River, and if there were just as many world-systems as there
would be grains of sand in them, would those world-systems be numerous?”[He said, “Quite
so, Lord, those world-systems would be numerous.”]The Lord said, “Subhūti, as many living
beings as there might be in those world-systems, I would know their manifold streams of thought.Why
is that? Those so-called ‘streams of thought,’ Subhūti, have been preached by the
Realized One as streamless. That is why they are called ‘streams of thought.’Why is that?
Subhūti, one cannot apprehend a past thought, one cannot apprehend a future thought, one
cannot apprehend a present [thought].

“What do you think, Subhūti? If someone were to fill this trigalactic megagalactic world-system
with the seven treasures and give it as a gift, would that gentleman or lady engender
a lot of merit on that basis?”He said, “A lot, Lord. A lot, Blessed One.”The Lord said, “Quite
so, Subhūti, quite so. It is a lot. That gentleman or lady would engender a lot of merit
on that basis. If there were a quantity of merit, Subhūti, the Realized One would not
have preached the so-called ‘quantity of merit.’
