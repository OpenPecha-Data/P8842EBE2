“If, however, some gentleman or lady were to fill as many world-systems as there are grains
of sand in the Ganges River with the seven treasures and give them as a gift to the Realized,
Worthy and Perfectly Awakened Ones, Subhūti, and if some bodhisattva were to attain acceptance
with regard to the fact that dharmas are devoid of self, [and devoid of arising,]1
the latter would generate from that a lot more merit. However, Subhūti, the quantity of
merit should not be acquired by the bodhisattva.”He said, “Lord, should the quantity of merit
be acquired?”The Lord said, “It should be acquired, Subhūti, but should not be taken up.
That is why one says ‘It should be acquired.’
