“However, Lord, the idea of a self will not occur to them, nor will the idea of a living being,
the idea of a soul, or the idea of a person occur.Why is that? Any such idea of a self
is indeed idealess, any idea of a living being, idea of a soul, or idea of a person is indeed
idealess.Why is that? Because the Buddhas and Lords are free of all ideas.”
