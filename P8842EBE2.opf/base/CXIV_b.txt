The Lord said, “It is in this way, Subhūti, that one who has set out on the bodhisattva path
should know all dharmas and have faith in them. But he should have faith in them in such
a way that even the idea of a dharma does not come to be present.Why is that? This so-called
‘idea of a dharma,’ Subhūti, has been preached by the Realized One as idealess. That is
why it is called the ‘idea of a dharma.’
