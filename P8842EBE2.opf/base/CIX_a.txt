“What do you think, Subhūti? Can a Realized One be seen by virtue of the perfection of his physical
body?”He said, “No, Lord, a Realized One cannot be seen by virtue of the perfection
of his physical body.Why is that? The so-called ‘perfection of the physical body’ has been
preached by the Realized One as perfectionless. That is why it is called the ‘perfection
of the physical body.’”
