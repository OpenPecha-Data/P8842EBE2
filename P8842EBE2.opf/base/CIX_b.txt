The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Can a Realized One be seen by virtue of the possession
of distinctive features?”He said, “No, Lord, a Realized One cannot be seen by virtue
of the possession of distinctive features.Why is that? What the Realized One has preached
as the possession of distinctive features has been preached by the Realized One as lacking
the possession of distinctive features. That is why it is called the possession of distinctive
features.”
