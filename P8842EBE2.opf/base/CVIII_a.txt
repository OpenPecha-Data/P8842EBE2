so, Lord, the Realized One has the eye of the flesh.”The Lord said, “What do you think,
Subhūti? Does the Realized One have the eye of the gods, the eye of insight, the eye of dharma,
the eye of the Awakened?”He said, “It is so, Lord, the Realized One has the eye of the
gods, the eye of insight, the eye of dharma, the eye of the Awakened.”
