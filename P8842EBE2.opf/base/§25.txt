“What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to the Realized One that he has liberated living
beings? This is again not the way one should see things, Subhūti.Why is that? There is no
living being whatsoever who has been liberated by the Realized One. If moreover there were
any living being who was liberated by the Realized One, Subhūti, that would constitute seizing
upon a self on his part, seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a soul, seizing upon
a person.This ‘seizing upon a self,’ Subhūti, has been preached by the Realized One as
devoid of seizing, but it is learned by foolish ordinary people.These ‘foolish ordinary people,’
Subhūti, have been preached by the Realized One as peopleless. That is why they are
called ‘foolish ordinary people.’
