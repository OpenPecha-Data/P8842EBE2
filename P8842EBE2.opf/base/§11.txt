The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? If there were just as many Ganges Rivers as there
are grains of sand in the Ganges River, would the grains of sand in them be numerous?”Subhūti
said, “That many Ganges Rivers alone would be numerous, Lord, to say nothing of the
grains of sand in them.”The Lord said, “I’ll tell you, Subhūti, I’ll have you know—if there
were as many world-systems as there would be grains of sand in those Ganges Rivers, and
some woman or man were to fill them with the seven treasures and make a gift of them to the
Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened Ones, what do you think, Subhūti, would that woman
or man generate a lot of merit on that basis?”Subhūti said, “A lot, Lord, a lot, Blessed
One. That woman or man would generate a lot of merit on that basis.”The Lord said, “If,
however, someone were to fill that many world-systems with the seven treasures and make a
gift of them, Subhūti, and if someone were to do no more than learn just a four-lined verse
from this round of teachings and teach it to others, the latter would generate from that
a lot more merit, an immeasurable and incalculable amount.
