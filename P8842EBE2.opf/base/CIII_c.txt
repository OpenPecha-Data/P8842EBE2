Would all the dust of the earth, Subhūti, that there is in the trigalactic megagalactic world-system
be a lot?”Subhūti said, “Lord, the dust of that much earth would be a lot. Any dust
of the earth preached by the Realized One, Lord, has been preached by the Realized One
as dustless. Thus it is called ‘the dust of the earth.’ Any world-system there is has been
preached by the Realized One as systemless. Thus it is called ‘a world-system.’”
