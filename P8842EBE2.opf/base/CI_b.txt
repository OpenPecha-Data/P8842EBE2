The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Would it occur to a Once-returner that he has obtained
the fruit of a Once-returner?”Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord. It does not occur to
a Once-returner that he has obtained the fruit of a Once-returner. What is the reason for
that? Because there is no dharma whatsoever which enters the state of being a Once-returner.
That is why one is called ‘a Once-returner.’”
