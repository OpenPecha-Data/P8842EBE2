The Lord said, “If, however, some woman or man were to sacrifice as many of their own bodies
as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, Subhūti, and if someone were to learn just
a four-lined verse from this round of teachings and teach it to others, the latter would
on that basis generate a lot more merit, an immeasurable and incalculable amount.”
