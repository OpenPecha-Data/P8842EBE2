What do you think, Subhūti, is it easy to take the measure of space in the east?”Subhūti said,
“Indeed not, Lord.”“Similarly, is it easy to take the measure of space in the south, west,
north, nadir, zenith, all the intermediate directions and any direction besides them,
in the ten directions?”Subhūti said, “Indeed not, Lord.”The Lord said, “Quite so, Subhūti.
Quite so, Subhūti. It is not easy to take the measure of the quantity of merit of the bodhisattva
who gives a gift without fixation.However, this is the way a bodhisattva should give
a gift, Subhūti, as an instance of the meritorious activity which consists in giving.“What
do you think, Subhūti, can a Realized One be seen by virtue of the possession of distinctive
features?”Subhūti said, “A Realized One cannot be seen by virtue of the possession
of distinctive features.Why is that? The very thing which the Realized One has preached as
the possession of distinctive features lacks any possession of distinctive features.”At
these words the Lord said this to the Venerable Subhūti,“Subhūti, as long as there is any
distinctive feature there is falsehood,and as long as there is no distinctive feature there
is no falsehood.Accordingly it is by virtue of the featurelessness of his distinctive features
that a Realized One can be seen.”
