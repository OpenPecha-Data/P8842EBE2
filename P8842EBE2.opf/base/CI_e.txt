“I am the one, Lord, who was designated by the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened One as
the foremost of those who live in peace, and I am, Lord, a Worthy One free of passion, but
it does not occur to me, Lord, that I am a Worthy One.If it were to occur to me, Lord,
that I have attained the state of a Worthy One, the Realized One would not have declared of
me ‘As the foremost of those who live in peace, the gentleman Subhūti does not live anywhere.
That is why he is the so-called “one who lives in peace”.’”
