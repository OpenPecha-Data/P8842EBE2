“I remember, Subhūti, that in the past, an incalculable aeon ago and more incalculable still,
back before the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened One Dīpaṃkara and back further still,
there were 84 hundred thousand million billion Buddhas with whom I found favour and
with whom, after finding favour, I did not lose favour.However, Subhūti, that previous quantity
of merit from when I found favour with the Buddhas and Lords, and after finding favour
with them, I did not lose favour, does not approach even a hundredth part, even a thousandth
part, even a hundred-thousandth part, even a hundred-thousand-millionth part, it does
not even permit of any calculation, or reckoning in fractions, or computation, or comparison,
or analogy, Subhūti, in relation to the quantity of merit from when, in the last time,
as the final five hundred years come to pass, they will learn, memorize, recite and master
this discourse.
