“Those gentlemen and ladies, Subhūti, who will learn, memorise and master such discourses as
these will be despised, they will be roundly despised.Whatever acts leading to perdition
those living beings have done in former rebirths, through being despised they will in this
life exhaust the demeritorious acts of their former rebirths, and they will attain the awakening
of a Buddha.
