“However, Subhūti, this round of teachings is inconceivable and incomparable.The Realized One
has preached this round of teachings for the benefit of living beings who have set out on
the highest path, for the benefit of living beings who have set out on the best path.Those
who will learn, memorise, recite, and master this round of teachings, the Realized One
knows them, Subhūti, the Realized One sees them, Subhūti.All those living beings will come
to be endowed with an immeasurable quantity of merit, they will come to be endowed with an
inconceivable, incomparable, unreckonable, measureless quantity of merit. [Those living
beings will all carry my awakening on their shoulders.]1Why is that? This dharma, Subhūti,
cannot be heard by those of inferior inclinations, nor can it be heard, or learned, or memorized,
or recited, or mastered by those who hold the false view of a self, who hold the
false view of a living being, who hold the false view of a soul, or who hold the false view
of a person. That is an impossibility.
