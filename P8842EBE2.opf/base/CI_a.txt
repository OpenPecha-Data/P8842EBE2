“What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to a Stream-enterer that he has obtained the fruit
of Stream-entry?”Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord. Why is that? Because, Lord, he has not
entered anything. That is why he is called a Stream-enterer. He has not entered form, nor
has he entered sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or dharmas. That is why he is called
‘a Stream-enterer.’”[(Cz 71,10-13:) If, O Lord, it would occur to the Streamwinner, ‘by
me has the fruit of a Streamwinner been attained’, then that would be in him a seizing of
self, seizing of a being, seizing of a soul, seizing of a person.]
