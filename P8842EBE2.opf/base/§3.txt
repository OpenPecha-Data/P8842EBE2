‘However many living beings are comprised in the total aggregation of living beings, be they
born from eggs, or born from wombs, or born from moisture, or arising spontaneously, whether
having physical form or being non-material,whether having apperception, or lacking apperception,
or neither having apperception nor lacking apperception—however the realm of living
beings is defined when one defines it—I should bring all of them to final extinction
in the realm of extinction without substrate remaining.But after I have brought immeasurable
living beings to final extinction in this way, no living being whatsoever has been brought
to extinction.’What is the reason for that? If, Subhūti, the idea of a living being occurs
to a bodhisattva, he should not be called a bodhisattva.Why is that? Subhūti, anybody
to whom the idea of a living being occurs, or the idea of a soul or the idea of a person
occurs, should not be called a bodhisattva.
