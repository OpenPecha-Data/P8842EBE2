Furthermore, the Lord said this to the Venerable Subhūti,“What do you think, Subhūti? Is there
anything whatsoever that the Realized One has fully awakened to, or any dharma whatsoever
that the Realized One has taught, as supreme and perfect awakening?”Subhūti said, “Lord,
as I understand the meaning of what the Lord has preached, there is no dharma whatsoever
that the Realized One has fully awakened to, nor any dharma whatsoever that the Realized
One has taught, as supreme and perfect awakening.Why is that? The dharma which the Realized
One has taught is ungraspable, it is ineffable, it is neither a dharma nor a non-dharma.Why
is that? Because the Noble Persons are distinguished by the power they derive from the
unconditioned.”
