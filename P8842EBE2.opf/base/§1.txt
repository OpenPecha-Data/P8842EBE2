This is the word as I heard it once when the Lord was staying in Śrāvastī, in Jetṛ’s Grove,
at the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍada, together with a large community of monks 1,250 monks strong.Then
the Lord got dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered the great
city of Śrāvastī for alms.Then, after walking around the great city of Śrāvastī for alms,
the Lord returned in the afternoon after eating the alms food, washed his feet, and sat
down on the seat set out for him with legs crossed, body held erect and attention directed
in front of him.Then a great many monks approached the Lord, and after approaching him they
prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, circumambulated the Lord three times, and sat
down to one side.
